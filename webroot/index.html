            <h3>What is a Pediatric Dentist?</h3>
            <p>Pediatric dentists have an additional 2-3 years of training to learn how to deal with the behavioral
              aspects of children, how to make them feel comfortable, and to make the experience pleasant in addition to
              clinical techniques specific to children. <span class="font--highlight">We are especially trained and qualified to treat patients with
              special needs.</span></p>

            <h3>What Makes Dentistry for Kids Special?</h3>
            <p>We make an extra effort to create an exciting environment which makes a big difference, especially in the
              case of the very apprehensive family. <span class="font--highlight">By bringing your child to a pediatric dentist as early as age one
              year</span>, you can ensure the timely prevention of dental disease and at the same time provide your child with
              an upbeat experience that can last a lifetime.</p>
